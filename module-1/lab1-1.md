## üß¨ Part 2: Fork and Clone the Workshop Repository

*Now let‚Äôs fork the repository and clone it locally so you can work with lab files in your own environment.*

1. Create a folder on your laptop where you'll clone the repository. For example, you can create a folder named `eppc25-tutorial` on your `C:` drive.

2. Open the GitHub repo in your browser:
   [https://github.com/Katerina-Chernevskaya/eppc25](https://github.com/Katerina-Chernevskaya/eppc25)

3. Click the **Fork** button in the top right corner and create a copy in your own GitHub account.

4. In your forked repository, click the `Code` button and copy the `Clone URL (HTTPS)`.

5. Open **PowerShell** or any terminal of your choice.

6. Navigate to a working directory where you want to clone the labs using `cd` command. For example:

   ```
   cd c:\eppc25-tutorial
   ```

7. Clone your forked repo (replace with the URL you copied in step 4):

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_CLONE_URL>
   ```
